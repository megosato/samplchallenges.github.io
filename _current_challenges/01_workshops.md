# Previous workshops

We had a 2019 [face-to-face workshop](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/d3r-2019-workshop) Aug. 22-23, 2019 in San Diego, joint with D3R. Due to technical difficulties, talk recordings are in general not available, unfortunately.

We ran a SAMPL virtual workshop Nov. 4-5, 2020, in coordination with GCC. Originally this had been planned to be a EuroSAMPL workshop in person in Germany, but with COVID-19 it was switched to a virtual format and had participation from the US, Europe, and elsewhere. This was a satellite meeting of the German Conference on Cheminformatics (GCC). Participants were encouraged to join both workshops.  [Full details are available on the GCC/SAMPL2020 site](https://www.gdch.de/gcc2020). [Slides (and in some cases video) from some talks are available online](https://zenodo.org/communities/sampl/?page=1&size=20); speakers also have recordings of their own talks, so if you are interested in a talk which is not available online, feel free to ask the speaker about it.

## The SAMPL7 host-guest virtual workshop

We had a virtual workshop on the [SAMPL7 host-guest challenge](https://zenodo.org/record/3674155); talks are online at that link and cite-able via the relevant DOI, along with the list of talks/schedule, etc.

## The SAMPL6 LogP Virtual Workshop

We had a virtual pre-workshop on the SAMPL6 LogP challenge on Thursday, May 16, 2019, beginning at 7 am US Pacific time.
