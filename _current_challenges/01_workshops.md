## EuroSAMPL2020

We're delighted to announce that we're running an in-person workshop in Mainz, Germany, Oct. 4-5, 2020, [**EuroSAMPL 2020**](/assets/pdf/EuroSAMPL2020.pdf), as a satellite meeting of the German Conference on Cheminformatics. Participants are encouraged to join both workshops.  

## Other potential workshops

- SAMPL 2021, dates TBD, Irvine, CA
- Possible EuroSAMPL in 2021 or 2022
- SAMPL 2022, dates TBD, Irvine, CA

# Previous workshops

We had a 2019 [face-to-face workshop](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/d3r-2019-workshop) Aug. 22-23, 2019 in San Diego, joint with D3R. Due to technical difficulties, talk recordings are in general not available, unfortunately.


## The SAMPL6 LogP Virtual Workshop

We had a virtual pre-workshop on the SAMPL6 LogP challenge on Thursday, May 16, 2019, beginning at 7 am US Pacific time.  [SAMPL6 logP virtual workshop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWUPXG8U3UE) and [presentation slides](https://github.com/choderalab/SAMPL6-logP-challenge-virtual-workshop) are now available.

### Overview/Purpose

The purpose of this workshop was to go over a preliminary evaluation of results, begin considering analysis and lessons learned, and nucleate opportunities for follow up and additional discussion. Part of the goal is to facilitate discussion so that participants can work *together* to maximize lessons learned in the lead up to the August in-person D3R/SAMPL workshop and the JCAMD special issue.
We hope this early workshop will result in additional follow-up afterwards.
