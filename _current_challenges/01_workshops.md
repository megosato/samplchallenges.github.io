## The SAMPL6 LogP Virtual Workshop

We have a virtual pre-workshop on the SAMPL6 LogP challenge on Thursday, May 16, beginning at 7 am US Pacific time.  

### Overview/Purpose

The purpose of this workshop is to go over a preliminary evaluation of results, begin considering analysis and lessons learned, and nucleate opportunities for follow up and additional discussion. Part of the goal is to facilitate discussion so that participants can work *together* to maximize lessons learned in the lead up to the August in-person D3R/SAMPL workshop and the JCAMD special issue.
We hope this early workshop will result in additional follow-up afterwards.

### Agenda

- **7-7:10 am**: *Welcome, introductions, and purpose*; David Mobley (UCI)
- **7:10-7:50 am**: *Experiments and overview of results*, Mehtap Isik (MSKCC); 30 minute talk + 10 minutes of questions/discussion.
