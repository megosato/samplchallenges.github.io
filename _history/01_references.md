## Additional references

A full list of the 100 SAMPL references we have identified is also available in the [SAMPL proposal](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7cf8c6cr); we plan to propagate a complete reference list to this website at some point. Please contact Danielle Bergazin (bergazin ‘at’ uci.edu) if you are aware of any additional references which should be included.
