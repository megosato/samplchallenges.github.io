Currently, [we are running a SAMPL7 physical properties challenge on pKa/logP (and PAMPA permeability)](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL7/tree/master/physical_property). Additionally, we launched [the first SAMPL8 challenge with host-guest binding to CB8](https://github.com/samplchallenges/sampl8). **For deadlines please refer to the relevant GitHub sites.** Stay tuned for further announcements relating to the SAMPL8 phase of challenges, and see our [roadmap](https://samplchallenges.github.io/roadmap/plans/) for what we can announce so far. Note that our EuroSAMPL workshop in Fall 2020 is being converted to an online format, and details for that will be out shortly.

To receive SAMPL e-mail announcements, please sign up for the [SAMPL e-mail list](http://eepurl.com/dPj11j).

[Our SAMPL7 host-guest challenge virtual workshop is up online](https://zenodo.org/record/3674155). And check our the [SAMPL Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/sampl?page=1&size=20) for additional SAMPL-related content.

**Data donation**: If you have, or can generate, high quality datasets which might be suitable for a future SAMPL challenge, please contact us, or see our Roadmap page for additional information on types of data which may be of particular interest.
