Current SAMPL challenges are closed, but stay tuned for additional challenges within SAMPL7, and for announcements relating to the SAMPL8 phase of challenges. Also, [note our **upcoming EuroSAMPL 2020 meeting**](/assets/pdf/EuroSAMPL2020.pdf).

To receive SAMPL e-mail announcements, please sign up for the [SAMPL e-mail list](http://eepurl.com/dPj11j). We also have e-mail lists for individual challenges which are available from the GitHub sites associated with each challenge or challenge component.

[Video from our recent SAMPL6 logP virtual workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWUPXG8U3UE) is now available. And check our the [SAMPL Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/sampl?page=1&size=20) for additional SAMPL-related content.

**Data donation**: If you have, or can generate, high quality datasets which might be suitable for a future SAMPL challenge, please contact us, or see our Roadmap page for additional information on types of data which may be of particular interest.
